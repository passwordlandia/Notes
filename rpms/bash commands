8.19 "Special" Characters and Operators
Before you learn about regular expressions ( 26.1 ) , you should understand how quoting ( 8.14 ) works in UNIX.

Regular expressions use metacharacters. The shells also have metacharacters. Metacharacters are simply characters that have a special meaning. The problem occurs when you want to use a regular expression in a shell script. Will the shell do something special with the character? Or will it be passed unchanged to the program? The $ character is a good example. It could be the beginning of a variable name or it could bepart of a regular expression . ( 26.2 ) If you need a regular expression, you must know if any of the characters of the expression are metacharacters, and must know the right way to quote that character so that it is passed to the program without being modified by the shell.

Table 8.3 is a table of special characters and operators in the C shell ( csh ) and Bourne shell ( sh ). The chart also includes several combinations of characters just to be complete. As in other parts of this book, the sh entries apply to ksh and bash ; the csh entries apply to tcsh .
